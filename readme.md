# JavaScript Playground #

This is a collection of JavaScript experiments and code snippets.  Hopefully this collection will grow over time and may prove interesting to someone. :)

Experiments:

* Canvas
	* CanvasFun.html - This file has three different experiments and is written without line-terminating semi-colons just for fun.  The lack of line-terminating semi-colons looks very odd to me,; but after reading some drama about them, I thought I'd experiment
		* Animated rotating squares
		* Mandelbrot fractal generator
		* Biomorph fractal generator
* Blowfish
	* A JavaScript implementation of Bruce Schneier's Blowfish algorithm
